Question about mk.test:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I noticed when running 94*.oc it marks line 7 column 10 (a ".") as an 
invalid source character however it isn't mentioned in asg2-scanner.pdf
that (.) is a special character. Is that something that should be 
ignored?
